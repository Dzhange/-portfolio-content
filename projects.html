			During my internship as a Computer Vision / Robotics Engineer at Righthand Robotics in summer 2022, I'm responsible for optimizing a bounding-box estimation algorithm from occluded partial RGBD point clouds.
			I used a denoising filter to remove outliers from captured point cloud, finally the accuracy improved 15% and the total space utilization improved 7%.

			At GeekPie, we designed a visual aid system, featuring path planning, navigation, and object detection to help the visually impaired in daily activities.
			To accomplish this, we assembled several sensors, including RGBD camera, microphone, GPS and a Gyro,
			together with a microcontroller into a bodypack, enabled it to run the algorithm we designed.

			We present a learning-based scheme for robustly and accurately estimating clothing fitness as well as the human shape on clothed 3D human scans. 
			Our approach maps the clothed human geometry to a geometry image that we call clothed-GI. To align clothed-GI under different clothing, 
			we extend the parametric human model and employ skeleton detection and warping for reliable alignment. 
			For each pixel on the clothed-GI, we extract a feature vector including color/texture, position, normal, etc. 
			and train a modified conditional GAN network for per-pixel fitness prediction using a comprehensive 3D clothing. 
			Our technique significantly improves the accuracy of human shape prediction, especially under loose and fitted clothing. 
			We further demonstrate using our results for human/clothing segmentation and virtual clothes fitting at a high visual realism
