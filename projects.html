			During my internship as a Computer Vision / Robotics Engineer at Righthand Robotics in summer 2022, I'm responsible for optimizing a bounding-box estimation algorithm from occluded partial RGBD point clouds.
			I used a denoising filter to remove outliers from captured point cloud, finally the accuracy improved 15% and the total space utilization improved 7%.

			At GeekPie, we designed a visual aid system, featuring path planning, navigation, and object detection to help the visually impaired in daily activities.
			To accomplish this, we assembled several sensors, including RGBD camera, microphone, GPS and a Gyro,
			together with a microcontroller into a bodypack, enabled it to run the algorithm we designed.
