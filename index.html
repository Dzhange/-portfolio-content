			I'm Ge Zhang, a second-year master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Computer Vision at University of Michigan. 
			I finished my undergrad at ShanghaiTech University. I've also spent some time researching at Stanford University.
			The goal of my research is to build a happier world with intelligent machines. During the past years I worked on computer vision&graphics, 
			and since last year I've been working on designing perception algorithm for robots.

			I love rock climbing, playing drums, and all forms of visual arts. I'm currently a member of UMich climbing club, and I climb regularly at Planet Rock.
			My favorite rock band is ACDC, my favorite ice cream flavor is rum and rasin, and my favorite drink is diet pepsi(yes, not coke).
            It's nice to meet you!
