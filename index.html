			I'm Ge Zhang, a second-year master student in Electrical and Computer Engineering - Computer Vision at University of Michigan. 
			I finished my undergrad at ShanghaiTech University. During the past years I worked on computer vision&graphics, 
			and since last year I've been working on designing perception algorithm for robots.<br><br>

        <p>
			I love rock climbing, playing drums, and all forms of visual arts. I'm currently a member of UMich climbing club, and I climb regularly at Planet Rock.
			My favorite rock band is ACDC, my favorite ice cream flavor is rum and rasin, and my favorite soda is diet moutain dew.
            It's nice to meet you!

			Here's something wrote with GPT: My homepage is a simple and clean design, with a white background and easy-to-read black text. The layout is organized and intuitive, with the main navigation menu at the top of the page and a brief introduction to myself and my work in the center. The homepage also features a selection of my recent projects and a brief overview of my skills and experience. Overall, the design of my homepage is professional and inviting, making it easy for visitors to learn more about me and my work.

			Here's a joke wrote with GPT: A man walks into a bar and sees a horse sitting at the counter. The man is surprised, but he figures it's a unique establishment, so he sits down next to the horse and orders a drink.

			The horse turns to the man and says, "I'm sorry, but I can't drink alcohol. I'm a horse, and it's bad for my health."
			
			The man is taken aback, but he's still curious, so he asks the horse, "What are you doing here if you can't drink alcohol?"
			
			The horse responds, "I'm here to pick up my rider. He's a regular at this bar, and he always forgets to take me home after he's had a few drinks. So I come here to wait for him and make sure he doesn't end up stumbling home alone."
			
			The man is impressed by the horse's dedication to his rider, so he buys the horse a non-alcoholic drink and they continue chatting until the rider shows up. The man leaves the bar feeling like he's made a new friend, and the horse goes home happy knowing that he's helped keep his rider safe.
